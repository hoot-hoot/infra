# adminfe
Why is favicon loaded so many times?
client.css should be served with an appropriate MIME type.
Component&unit tests
Take ownership of caching of /real/client resources.
Good story about multiple versions of resources & long-term caching of the dependent resource
Comments
Fix strange Rollbar error when rebuilding
Have a default image before the profile picture loads.
Use client timezone in SSR otherwise React complains about time mismatches
Allow selection of a favicon in the site menu.
Just after login, the preview button is shown - bugfix.
Pressing on logo takes you to hero page
Tests for SSR

# sitefe
Also generate keywords. According to blog, and according to post
Humans.txt should contain data about the person, not base63

The order in which images is specified isn't maintained.
Bold when&where
When it's too small allow a larger height for when&where

# Identity
Return user info if there is any in the getSession API! - super important
Just have a getSession method which retrieves the session _and_ user depending on whether the auth0 info is present or not.
Some sort of tests that when credentials are passed in, the same credentials are obtained. A method won't change the credentials - cookie store etc.
What to do with a session that does not exist? Pops up a lot in testing.
Testing for api-gateway-router
Error checking for the fetch for api-gateway-router
Add tests for cache behaviour.

# Content
Add an index on events.current_active_subdomain and try public lookups through that, and only when it fails try through the join table. On the common case it'll be just one index lookup + tree lookup rather than one index lookup + tree lookup + tree lookup.
Better marshalling for the display info.

# End-To-End
Tests with Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari/IE11 on Win/Linux/MacOS
Tests that all the requests that are made are to _our_ domain or a whitelist of external domains.
Tests that content that is too big json-wise gets rejected
Factor out hosts into constants.
Test that some paths have sessions while others don't (/real/client or /robots etc)

# Global
Have a story for unified sessions across services. Probably some iframe+postmessage stuff OR some CORS stuff.
Mark some volumes as read-only (node_modules, build, src etc.)
Update to docker-compose v3 syntax
Tests which depend on time implicitly should have Date.now mocked!
Limits for all fields, especially free-form ones. Enforce at marshaller level. Also update adminfe title editor with this stuff.
MessageWith0Arg<value marshaller> marshaller.
Make all fetches from the interface cancellable and cancel them in componentDidUnmount();
Use lighthouse - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/
Revert to secure weburis for Auth0Profile & User pictureUris.

#infra

Use google image builder for building the identity/content/adminfe/sitefe images. Can then make the travis builds sudo: false
Steps so far:
- create chmsqrt2-truesparrow-common project
- create a service account for pushing stuff from the CI. Add the roles/storage.adminrole to it.
- create cloud repositories for each of the 4 services we have
