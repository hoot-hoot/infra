Why is favicon loaded so many times?
client.css should be served with an appropriate MIME type.
Component&unit tests

# Identity
Return user info if there is any in the getSession API! - super important
Just have a getSession method which retrieves the session _and_ user depending on whether the auth0 info is present or not.
Some sort of tests that when credentials are passed in, the same credentials are obtained. A method won't change the credentials - cookie store etc.
What to do with a session that does not exist? Pops up a lot in testing.
Testing for api-gateway-router
Error checking for the fetch for api-gateway-router
Add tests for cache behaviour.

# End-To-End
Tests with Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari/IE11 on Win/Linux/MacOS
Tests that all the requests that are made are to _our_ domain or a whitelist of external domains.

# Global
Have a story for unified sessions across services. Probably some iframe+postmessage stuff OR some CORS stuff.
Mark some volumes as read-only (node_modules, build, src etc.)
Update to docker-compose v3 syntax
Tests which depend on time implicitly should have Date.now mocked!

#infra

Use google image builder for building the identity/content/adminfe/sitefe images. Can then make the travis builds sudo: false
Steps so far:
- create chmsqrt2-truesparrow-common project
- create a service account for pushing stuff from the CI. Add the roles/storage.adminrole to it.
- create cloud repositories for each of the 4 services we have
